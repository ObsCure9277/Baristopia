    <p>By using our Website and/or App, you represent that you are at least the age of majority and have given us your consent to allow any of your minor dependents to use our Website and/or App and be responsible for the actions of the minor dependent.</p>

    <h4><b><li>How You Can Withdraw Your Consent?</li></b></h4>

    <p>You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at <strong><a href="mailto:support@baristopia.com">support@baristopia.com</a></strong>. After you have chosen to withdraw your consent, we may continue to process your Personal Information to the extent required or otherwise permitted by applicable laws and regulations.</p>

    <h4><b><li>How We Disclose Your Personal Information?</li></b></h4>

    <p>We may disclose your Personal Information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service. We may also disclose your information to various third parties, including but not limited to our subsidiaries, associated companies, jointly controlled entities, affiliates, service providers, and business partners.</p>

    <p>In general, the third-party providers or vendors used by us will only collect, use, and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us. However, certain third-party service providers or vendors, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, may have their own privacy policies regarding the information that we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.</p>

    <p>For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies to understand how your Personal Information will be handled. Please remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. If you proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party provider, your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located. Once you leave our Website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service.</p>

    <p>When you click on links on our Website, they may direct you away from our Website. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy policies.</p>

    <h4><b><li>How We Retain Your Personal Data?</li></b></h4>

    <p>We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary for the purpose of this Privacy Policy and to the extent required or otherwise permitted by applicable laws and regulations. When we no longer require your Personal Information, we will take steps to erase, remove, destroy, anonymize, or prevent access to or use of your Personal Information.</p>

    <p>If our store is acquired, merged, sold, or entered into a joint venture, consolidation, restructuring, financing, or any other type of business transaction with another company, your information may be shared or transferred to the other parties.</p>

    <h4><b><li>How We Secure Your Personal Information?</li></b></h4>

    <p>To protect your Personal Information, we take reasonable legal precautions and follow industry best practices and standards to ensure your Personal Information is protected. This includes measures to prevent your Personal Information from being lost, used, accessed, disclosed, or altered in an unauthorized way or being destroyed. All information on our website is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with AES-128 encryption. Although no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry best practices and standards.</p>

    <h4><b><li>How We Manage Cookies?</li></b></h4>

    <p>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier among others, that is sent and stored on your computer or mobile device in emails and/or notifications that we send to you on our Website and/or App. Cookies are required to use our Website and/or App. Third parties may be able to associate the Personal Information they collect with other personal information they have about you from other sources.
